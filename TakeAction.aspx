        <h2>Conferences</h2>
        <p>Beyond Trafficking along with our partners hold a conference that will facilitate panels, discussions, and workshops covering prevention, identification, treatment, investigations and prosecutions. Our conference is scheduled for April of every year. For more information and dates, sign up for our mailing list.</p>
        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>
          Smaller than a conference but a little smaller are our workshops that are hosted throughout the year. We provide new developments in the anti-human trafficking space and training that will make your efforts more impactful. 
          <br />
          We also provide workshops on demand for small groups. 
        </p>
        <h2>Fundraise</h2>
